   * MboxGrid (メール一覧)
     * FIXED: QADB: 915727 (..移動・削除時の「読み込み中」の表示をスキップする )
       This is part of an IO optimization which reduces HTTP calls as well
       as fixes an issue with the original Rico LiveGrid.
       Deleting/moving rows from the VirtualScrollingTable will not be handled
       more intelligently.

     * FIXED: QADB: 915030 (..未読にするとメール一覧上のスタイルが崩れる.. )
     * IMPLEMENTED: Multiple-selection is context-aware:
       For a selection of mails that all have the same status, the
       context-menu (右クリックメニュー) will show only the option to switch
       to the other state. Inversely, if the selection contains both states
       i.e., some mails are read (既読) while others are unread (未読) the
       menu will show both options - mark as read (既読にする) and mark as
       unread (未読にする). The same for Flagged, etc

 * 2007/05/06
   * MboxGrid (メール一覧)
     * FIXED: QADB: 914913 (宛先に自分のメールアドレスが存在する場合は...)

       Supports multiple deletion via CTRL-click.

   * MboxGrid (メール一覧)
     * FIXED: QADB: 914942
       An optimization in the row-blanking lead caused this - the grid
       was not getting blanked when it really ought to (when there are 
       no mails in a folder). This is now fixed.


 * 2007/05/02
   * MboxGrid (メール一覧)
     * PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT: Enabled the 'Fake-table' optimization
       The VirtualScrollingTable for MboxGrid is now built out of DIVs,
       which yeilds much faster refresh times.
       3-7 times faster than before.
     * IMPLEMENTED: Column resize for 'Fake-table'
     * APPEARANCE(見た目): 
       1. Removed the dotted border.
       2. Seen messages (既読) are now no longer displayed with a gray
          background.
       3. Removed cell borders lines.


 * 2007/04/27
   * MboxGrid (メール一覧)
     * PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT: 'Tiny Scroll' optimization: 
       For scrolls of small offset sizes (Example, scrolling 1-2 rows),
       a 'row-shifting' optimization is performed (shifting rows from the top
       to the bottom, or vice-versa)
       before: 300 ms,  after: 70 ms  (For a single-row scroll)  - 
       (IE6 on a P4 3.2GHz)
     * FIXED: 914873, 914801, 914814

     * ADDED: Icons for high priority, low priority
     * ADDED: Icons for seen/unseen (未読、既読)
     * ENHANCEMENT: Resize Performance optimization - faster (height) resizing 
       When resizing the window, there should be a 50% - 200%
       performance increase.
   * ThreePane
     * ENHANCEMENT: Puppy (パピー)
       1. Loading indication during IMAP folder update (INBOX クリック)
       2. Loading indication when a mail is loaded (メール詳細)
       3. Puppy appears within the ThreePane (no outside it)
       4. ThreePane now fills up the unused area on the bottom.
     * FIXED: MessageViewer (mail preview): (メール詳細)

       no longer breaks the ThreePane layout in IE

        Right-clicking a row (右クリック) now correctly also selects the row.
      * FIXED: Row selection caching corrected
        Row selection will now correctly not retain selected state
        across folders.
      * IMPLEMENTED: MessageSearcher support (詳細検索)
      * ENHANCEMENT: Grid Row-Refresh Performance Enhancement:
        Scrollbar size updates are now done only when 
        the data changes (during JSON-IO) instead of on each refresh.
        Scrolling is now around 20% faster.
